0,Analysis of Citizens Acceptance for E-government Services: Applying the UTAUT Model,"E-government services aims to provide citizens with more accessible,
accurate, real-time and high quality services and information. Although the
public sectors in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have promoted their
e-Government services for many years, its uses and achievements are few.
Therefore, this paper explores the key factors of Saudi citizens acceptance
through a research survey and by gathering empirical evidence based on the
Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey Data
collected from 400 respondents was examined using structural equation modelling
(SEM) technique and utilized AMOS tools. The study results explored the factors
that affect the acceptance of e-government services in KSA based on UTAUT
model. Moreover, as a result of this study an amended UTAUT model was proposed.
Such a model contributes to the discussion and development of adoption models
for technology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3157v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3157v1
1,The Effects of Website Quality on Adoption of E-Government Service: AnEmpirical Study Applying UTAUT Model Using SEM,"In today global age, e-government services have become the main channel for
online communication between the government and its citizens. They aim to
provide citizens with more accessible, accurate, real-time and high quality
services. Therefore, the quality of government websites which provide
e-services is an essential factor in the successful adoption of e-government
services by the public. This paper discusses an investigation of the effect of
the Website Quality (WQ) factor on the acceptance of using e-government
services (G2C) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) by adopting the Unified
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) Model. Survey Data collected
from 400 respondents were examined using the structural equation modelling
(SEM) technique and utilising AMOS tools. This study found that the factors
that significantly influenced the Use Behaviour of e-government services in KSA
(USE) include Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort expectancy (EE), Facilitating
Conditions (FC) and Website Quality (WQ), while the construct known Social
Influence (SI) did not. Moreover, the results confirm the importance of quality
government websites and support systems as one of the main significant and
influential factors of e-government services adoption. The results of this
study can be helpful to Saudi governmental sectors to adjust their corporate
strategies and plans to advance successful adoption and diffusion of
e-government services (G2C) in KSA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2410v1
2,The Moderating Effect of Gender on Adopting Digital Government Innovations in Ethiopia,"Digital government innovation is being recognised as a solution to many
problems faced by governments in providing services to their citizens. It is
especially important for low-income countries where there are resource
constraints. This research was aimed at exploring the moderating effect of
gender on the adoption of a digital government innovation in Ethiopia based on
the UTAUT model (n=270) and using structural equation modeling (SEM). The
results reveal that gender only moderates the relationship between facilitating
conditions and usage behavior of government employees to adopt the digital
government innovation which is inconsistent with other findings. Another key
finding was that even though the innovation was regarded as not being easy to
use, women identified that they would still use it because of the social
influence from the peers and the bosses. This finding suggests that women
government employees who obtain external support are more likely to use digital
government innovations compared with men who are unlikely to use it even if
they were facilitated. The paper recommends that governments of low-income
countries like Ethiopia should design appropriate policies that encourage women
in digital government.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09960v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09960v1
3,"Reputation, Risk, and Trust on User Adoption of Internet Search Engines: The Case of DuckDuckGo","This paper investigates the determinants of end-user adoption of the
DuckDuckGo search engine coupling the standard UTAUT model with factors to
reflect reputation, risk, and trust. An experimental approach was taken to
validate our model, where participants were exposed to the DuckDuckGo product
using a vignette. Subsequently, answering questions on their perception of the
technology. The data was analyzed using the partial least squares-structural
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. From the nine distinct factors studied,
we found that 'Performance Expectancy' played the greatest role in user
decisions on adoption, followed by 'Firm Reputation', 'Initial Trust in
Technology', 'Social Influence', and an individual's 'Disposition to Trust'. We
conclude by exploring how these findings can explain DuckDuckGo's rising
prominence as a search engine.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19679-9_87,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09428v3
4,VTracker: Impact of User Factors On Users' Intention to Adopt Dietary Intake Monitoring System with Auto Workout Tracker,"Nowadays, Malaysian are so concerned about their body health. In respond to
this, this study proposed a conceptual prototype called vTracker to assist its
users to have a healthier body. vTracker is a web-based mobile application
which helps users to self-monitor their dietary intakes and workout activities
in a few simple steps. A research framework has been proposed using the Unified
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to understand the
level of users' intention to adopt vTracker in Malaysia. Data was collected
from 206 respondents in Malaysia using survey method. Based on the result of
the analysis, it was found that respondents agree to subscribe to the system.
It addition to that, it was found that the three factors have a positive impact
on users' intention to adopt vTracker. These mentioned factors are performance
effort expectancy (PEE), social influence (SI) and facilitating condition (FC).
These significant factors are used for designing vTracker portal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06684v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06684v1
